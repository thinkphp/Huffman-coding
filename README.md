# Huffman-coding
Huffman coding is an efficient method of compressing data without losing information. In computer science, information is encoded as bitsâ€”1's and 0's. Strings of bits encode the information that tells a computer which instructions to carry out. Video games, photographs, movies, and more are encoded as strings of bits in a computer. Computers execute billions of instructions per second, and a single video game can be billions of bits of data. It is easy to see why efficient and unambiguous information encoding is a topic of interest in computer science.
